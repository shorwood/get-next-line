3. Or maybe it's that it feels like all our heroes are counterfeit?

5. Spamming each other with our running commentary of bullshit, masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy. Or is it that we voted for this? Not with our rigged elections, but with our things, our property, our money.

10. Fuck society.
